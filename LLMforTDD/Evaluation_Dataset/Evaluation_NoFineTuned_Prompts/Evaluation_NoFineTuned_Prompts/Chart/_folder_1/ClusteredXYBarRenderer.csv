Write a JUnit test method for the Java method described below. The test method should have proper and relevant assert statements and avoid repetition of assert statements.
@Test public void testName() { /*assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult); assertTrue(someCondition); assertFalse(someCondition); */}

Class: ClusteredXYBarRenderer, Method: getPassCount
Description: /**
* Returns the number of passes through the dataset that this renderer
* requires.  In this case, two passes are required, the first for drawing
* the shadows (if visible), and the second for drawing the bars.
*
* @return <code>2</code>.

Class: ClusteredXYBarRenderer, Method: drawItem
Description: /**
* Draws the visual representation of a single data item. This method
* is mostly copied from the superclass, the change is that in the
* calculated space for a singe bar we draw bars for each series next to
* each other. The width of each bar is the available width divided by
* the number of series. Bars for each series are drawn in order left to
* right.
*
* @param g2  the graphics device.
* @param state  the renderer state.
* @param dataArea  the area within which the plot is being drawn.
* @param plot  the plot (can be used to obtain standard color
*              information etc).
* @param domainAxis  the domain axis.
* @param rangeAxis  the range axis.
* @param dataset  the dataset.
* @param series  the series index.
* @param item  the item index.
* @param pass  the pass index.

Description: /**

* <code>ClusteredXYBarRenderer</code> with the same settings as this

*
* @param obj  the object (<code>null</code> permitted).

Description: /**

* @return A clone.
*
* @throws CloneNotSupportedException  if the renderer cannot be cloned.
