Description: /**
* Returns the fraction of the domain position between two points on which
* the step is drawn.  The default is 1.0d, which means the step is drawn
* at the domain position of the second`point. If the stepPoint is 0.5d the
* step is drawn at half between the two points.
*
* @return The fraction of the domain position between two points where the
*         step is drawn.
