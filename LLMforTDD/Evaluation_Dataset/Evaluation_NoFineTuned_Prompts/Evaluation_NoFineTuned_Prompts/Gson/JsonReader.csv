description
Write a JUnit test method for the Java method described below. The test method should have proper and relevant assert statements and avoid repetition of assert statements.
@Test public void testName() { /*assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult); assertTrue(someCondition); assertFalse(someCondition); */}
Class: JsonReader
"Method: setLenient
Description: /**
* Configure this parser to be  be liberal in what it accepts. By default,
* this parser is strict and only accepts JSON as specified by <a
"* href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt">RFC 4627</a>. Setting the"
* parser to lenient causes it to ignore the following syntax errors:
*
* <ul>
"*   <li>Streams that start with the <a href="#nonexecuteprefix">non-execute"
*       prefix</a>," <code>")]}'\n"</code>."
*   <li>Streams that include multiple top-level values. With strict parsing,
*       each stream must contain exactly one top-level value.
*   <li>Top-level values of any type. With strict parsing, the top-level
*       value must be an object or an array.
*   <li>Numbers may be {@link Double#isNaN() NaNs} or {@link
*       Double#isInfinite() infinities}.
*   <li>End of line comments starting with {@code //} or {@code #} and
*       ending with a newline character.
*   <li>C-style comments starting with {@code /*} and ending with
*       {@code *}{@code /}. Such comments may not be nested.
*   <li>Names that are unquoted or {@code 'single quoted'}.
*   <li>Strings that are unquoted or {@code 'single quoted'}.
*   <li>Array elements separated by {@code ;} instead of {@code ,}.
*   <li>Unnecessary array separators. These are interpreted as if null
*       was the omitted value.
*   <li>Names and values separated by {@code =} or {@code =>} instead of
*       {@code :}.
*   <li>Name/value pairs separated by {@code ;} instead of {@code ,}.
* </ul>
