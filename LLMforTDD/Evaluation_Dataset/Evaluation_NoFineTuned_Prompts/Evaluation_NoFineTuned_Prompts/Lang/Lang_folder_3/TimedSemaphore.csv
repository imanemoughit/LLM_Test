Write a JUnit test method for the Java method described below. The test method should have proper and relevant assert statements and avoid repetition of assert statements.
@Test public void testName() { /*assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult); assertTrue(someCondition); assertFalse(someCondition); */}

* to a value &lt;= {@link #NO_LIMIT} will cause the limit to be disabled,
