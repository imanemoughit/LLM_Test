Description: /*** <p>Deep clone an {@code Object} using serialization.</p>

* <p>This is many times slower than writing clone methods by hand
* on all objects in your object graph. However, for complex object
* graphs, or for those that don't support deep cloning this can
* be a simple alternative implementation. Of course all the objects
* must be {@code Serializable}.</p>

* @return the cloned object
* @throws SerializationException (runtime) if the serialization fails
