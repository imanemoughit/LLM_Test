Write a JUnit test method for the Java method described below. The test method should have proper and relevant assert statements and avoid repetition of assert statements.
@Test public void testName() { /*assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult); assertTrue(someCondition); assertFalse(someCondition); */}
