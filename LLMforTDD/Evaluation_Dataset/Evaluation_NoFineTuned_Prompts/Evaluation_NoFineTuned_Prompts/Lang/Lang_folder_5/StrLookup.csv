Class: StrLookup, Method: lookup
Description: /*** Looks up a String key to a String value.
* <p>
* The internal implementation may use any mechanism to return the value.
* The simplest implementation is to use a Map. However, virtually any
* implementation is possible.
* <p>
* For example, it would be possible to implement a lookup that used the
* key as a primary key, and looked up the value on demand from the database
* Or, a numeric based implementation could be created that treats the key
* as an integer, increments the value and return the result as a string -
* converting 1 to 2, 15 to 16 etc.
* <p>
* The {@link #lookup(String)} method always returns a String, regardless of
* the underlying data, by converting it as necessary. For example:
* <pre>
* Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<String, Object>();
* map.put(number, Integer.valueOf(2));
* assertEquals(2, StrLookup.mapLookup(map).lookup(number));
* </pre>
* @param key  the key to be looked up, may be null
* @return the matching value, null if no match
