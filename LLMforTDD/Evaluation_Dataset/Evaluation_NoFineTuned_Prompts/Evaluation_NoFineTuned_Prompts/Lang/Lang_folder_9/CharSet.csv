Write a JUnit test method for the Java method described below. The test method should have proper and relevant assert statements and avoid repetition of assert statements.
@Test public void testName() { /*assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult); assertTrue(someCondition); assertFalse(someCondition); */}

Class: CharSet, Method: getInstance
Description: /*** <p>Factory method to create a new CharSet using a special syntax.</p>
*
* <ul>
*  <li>{@code null} or empty string ()
* - set containing no characters</li>
*  <li>Single character, such as a
*  - set containing just that character</li>
*  <li>Multi character, such as a-e
*  - set containing characters from one character to the other</li>
*  <li>Negated, such as ^a or ^a-e
*  - set containing all characters except those defined</li>
*  <li>Combinations, such as abe-g
*  - set containing all the characters from the individual sets</li>
* </ul>
*
* <p>The matching order is:</p>
* <ol>
*  <li>Negated multi character range, such as ^a-e
*  <li>Ordinary multi character range, such as a-e
*  <li>Negated single character, such as ^a
*  <li>Ordinary single character, such as a
* </ol>
* <p>Matching works left to right. Once a match is found the
* search starts again from the next character.</p>
*
* <p>If the same range is defined twice using the same syntax, only
* one range will be kept.
* Thus, a-ca-c creates only one range of a-c.</p>
*
* <p>If the start and end of a range are in the wrong order,
* they are reversed. Thus a-e is the same as e-a.
* As a result, a-ee-a would create only one range,
* as the a-e and e-a are the same.</p>
*
* <p>The set of characters represented is the union of the specified ranges.</p>
*
* <p>All CharSet objects returned by this method will be immutable.</p>
*
* @param setStrs  Strings to merge into the set, may be null
* @return a CharSet instance
* @since 2.4
