Class: ConcurrentUtils, Method: extractCause
Description: /*** Inspects the cause of the specified {@code ExecutionException} and
* creates a {@code ConcurrentException} with the checked cause if
* necessary. This method performs the following checks on the cause of the
* passed in exception:
* <ul>
* <li>If the passed in exception is <b>null</b> or the cause is
* <b>null</b>, this method returns <b>null</b>.</li>
* <li>If the cause is a runtime exception, it is directly thrown.</li>
* <li>If the cause is an error, it is directly thrown, too.</li>
* <li>In any other case the cause is a checked exception. The method then
* creates a {@link ConcurrentException}, initializes it with the cause, and

Description: /*** Inspects the cause of the specified {@code ExecutionException} and

* the cause of the specified {@code ExecutionException} is extracted as a

Description: /*** Handles the specified {@code ExecutionException}. This method calls

* being thrown. If the cause is a checked exception however, it is wrapped

* exception is <b>null</b> or has no cause, the method simply returns
* without throwing an exception.

Class: ConcurrentUtils, Method: putIfAbsent
Description: /*** <p>
* Puts a value in the specified {@code ConcurrentMap} if the key is not yet
* present. This method works similar to the {@code putIfAbsent()} method of
* the {@code ConcurrentMap} interface, but the value returned is different.
* Basically, this method is equivalent to the following code fragment:
*
* <pre>
* if (!map.containsKey(key)) {
*     map.put(key, value);
*     return value;
* } else {
*     return map.get(key);
* }
* </pre>
*
* except that the action is performed atomically. So this method always
* returns the value which is stored in the map.
* </p>
* <p>
* This method is <b>null</b>-safe: It accepts a <b>null</b> map as input
* without throwing an exception. In this case the return value is
* <b>null</b>, too.

* @param <V> the type of the values of the map
* @param map the map to be modified
* @param key the key of the value to be added
* @param value the value to be added
* @return the value stored in the map after this operation

Class: ConcurrentUtils, Method: createIfAbsent
Description: /*** Checks if a concurrent map contains a key and creates a corresponding

* given map. If it is already contained, its value is returned. Otherwise
* the {@code get()} method of the passed in {@link ConcurrentInitializer}
* is called. With the resulting object
* {@link #putIfAbsent(ConcurrentMap, Object, Object)} is called. This
* handles the case that in the meantime another thread has added the key to
* the map. Both the map and the initializer can be <b>null</b>; in this
