Write a JUnit test method for the Java method described below. The test method should have proper and relevant assert statements and avoid repetition of assert statements.
@Test public void testName() { /*assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult); assertTrue(someCondition); assertFalse(someCondition); */}

Class: CharSequenceTranslator, Method: translate
Description: /*** Translate a set of codepoints, represented by an int index into a CharSequence,
* into another set of codepoints. The number of codepoints consumed must be returned,
* and the only IOExceptions thrown must be from interacting with the Writer so that
* the top level API may reliably ignore StringWriter IOExceptions.
*
* @param input CharSequence that is being translated
* @param index int representing the current point of translation
* @param out Writer to translate the text to
* @return int count of codepoints consumed
* @throws IOException if and only if the Writer produces an IOException
